                        <p>
                            Many thanks for choosing to purchase a membership with us! Your membership is valid
                            until the end of the calendar year. It entitles you to vote in our Annual General Meeting,
                            and to reduced prices for our events. In order to claim these benefits, you must bring
                            your membership card (attached and shown below) with you and show it to our volunteers
                            on the door. They will scan the QR code to verify your membership.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We're very happy for you to use this digital membership card, but if you'd like a
                            physical one as well,
                            please email info@esds.org.uk to request one; We'll have one prepared for you to collect
                            on one of our regular Thursdays within a week or two. We're also happy for you to print
                            this card off in any medium you wish, provided the card can still be read by both human
                            and machine.

                        <p>
                            ESDS is entirely run by volunteers, and we are always looking for new volunteers to join
                            us on class and
                            event nights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Volunteering can take many forms including DJs, Teachers, Event Staff, Door Staff, and
                            many more. Anyone
                            volunteering does not have to pay on nights they volunteer!
                        </p>
